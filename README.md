## Project Summary
The so-called Generation Z will soon overtake Millennials (Generation Y) as the largest and most a number generation on planet Earth, with over a third of the global population identifying as Gen Zers. As Gen Zers prepare to enter the global stage, the consequences will be immediate and deep, with repercussions in job roles, commercial consumption, science and technology, politics, and society. Unlike Generation Y, this generation of people has a completely different outlook on employment and how they measure achievement throughout life and the workplace.  

To become more familiar with the issues faced by this growing workforce and their consequences on companies and the workplace this project aims on such related problems.  

As we learn about the interests and behaviors of our newest workforce members, we must also consider how "work" is changing and evolving. The new realities created by these engines of change raise complex challenges, such as the ethics of human-machine partnership, how to prepare for 50–60-year professions, and the way we liberate companies over an endless variety of talent sources. 

## Data Source
The dataset obtained from Kaggle which revolves around the career aspirations of Gen-Z and has about 2634 rows and 15 fields of information collected as a form of a Survey, primarily from India and few other countries as well.

## Data Cleaning
All categorical features are in long format therefore by using power query editor in Microsoft Excel, we have made it short without changing its meaning for better visualization and data labelling.

## Data visualization techniques
After data cleaning, a set of research questions were formed to obtain the insights from the data considering the aim of the project.  

We worked on this data using Microsoft Excel out of the provided data visualization tools. For analyzing the data Pivot Tables were utilized extensively and graph were used from Pivot chart.

## Future work

2) Current dataset mainly consists the answers of participants of the survey from India. Future work might be supposed to include more participants from different countries to make comprehensive and multi-cultural analysis.
